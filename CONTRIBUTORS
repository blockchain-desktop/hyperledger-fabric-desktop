# This is the official list of people who have contributed
# code to the hyperledger-fabric-desktop repository.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people.  For example, Yonyou employees are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because Yonyou holds the copyright.

# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Individual's name <submission email address>
#     Individual's name <submission email address> <email2> <emailN>
#
# An entry with multiple email addresses specifies that the
# first address should be used in the submit logs.

# Please append your name at the end of the list. We recommend
# you to use English name, although the name can be written in
# any language if you like.
